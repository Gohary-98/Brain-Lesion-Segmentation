Brain Lesion Segmentation using Deep Learning &amp; Transfer Learning

Brain lesion segmentation is the process of labeling the cells of the brain with its corresponding class to make it easier to detect abnormal cells. The segmentation task is normally done manually by experts, but researchers are trying to find automated ways to do this task. In this project, the prospect of using deep learning was explored to automate this task.
The objective of the project is to use transfer learning to be able to perform automatic Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation by using a pre-trained model on brain lesion segmentation which is a similar domain to MS lesions. The usefulness of transfer learning in this task where there is data limitation in the MS lesions was explored. The first step was to train on a relatively large dataset of brain lesions of patients diagnosed with gliomas, and then use this model to train and segment less common lesions such as MS.
